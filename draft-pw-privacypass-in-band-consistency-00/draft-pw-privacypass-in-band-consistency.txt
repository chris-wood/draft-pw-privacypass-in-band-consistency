1.  Introduction

   Key and configuration consistency is an important preqrequisite for
   guaranteeing security properties of Privacy Pass.  In particular,
   privacy informally depends on Clients using an Issuer key that many,
   if not all, other Clients use.  If a Client were to receive an Issuer
   key that was specific to them, or restricted to a small set of
   Clients, then use of that Issuer key could be used to learn targeted
   information about the Client.  Clients that share the same Issuer key
   are said to have a consisten key.

   [CONSISTENCY] describes general patterns for implementing consistency
   in protocols such as Privacy Pass, and [K-CHECK] describes a
   protocol-agnostic mechanism for implementing consistency checks that
   can apply to Privacy Pass.  K-Check is an orthogonal protocol for
   checking consistency of a given key that runs out-of-band of Privacy
   Pass.

   This document specifies an in-band consistency check for Privacy
   Pass.  It is only applicable to deployments where the Attester is
   split from the Origin and Issuer.  This is because the Attester is
   responsible for enforcing consistency on behalf of many Clients.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Attester Consistency Check

   In Privacy Pass deployment models where the Attester is split from
   the Origin and Issuer, Clients interact with the Attester to run the
   issuance protocol for obtaining tokens.  In particular, Clients
   obtain tokens from the Issuer by sending token requests to the
   Attester, which forwards token requests to the Issuer.  As an active,
   on-path participant in the issuance protocol, the Attester is capable
   of applying enforcement checks for these token requests.  This
   section describes a simple key consistency enforcement check to
   ensure that all Clients behind the Attester share a consistent view
   of the Issuer key.

   Upon receipt of a token request, which contains a key ID as described
   in [PRIVACYPASS-ISSUANCE], an Attester does the following:

   1.  The Attester checks that it has a cached copy of the private
       token directory from the Issuer corresponding to the token
       request.  If the Attester does not, it first obtains a copy of
       the directory.  If this fails, the Attester aborts the token
       request with a failure.

   2.  The Attester compares the key ID corresponding in the token
       request to the the valid keys in the directory.  If no match is
       found, the Attester aborts token request with a failure.

   3.  If the above steps succeed, the Attester allows the token request
       to proceed.

   Attesters can update their cached copy of Issuer token directories
   independently of token requests.  Attesters SHOULD refresh their
   cached copy of the Issuer directory when it becomes invalid
   (according to cache control headers).

   Attesters SHOULD enforce that Issuer directories contain few keys
   suitable for use at any given point in time, and penalize or reject
   Issuers that advertise too many keys.  This is because Clients and
   Origins may choose different keys from this directory based on their
   local state, e.g., their clock, and too many keys could be misused
   for the purposes of partitioning Client anonymity sets.

4.  Security Considerations

   Unlike K-Check, in which Clients can check key consistency against
   the first valid key in an Issuer private token directory, the
   Attester consistency check in this document needs to allow for
   greater flexibility, in particular because Client diversity and
   differences may lead to different key selections.  Attesters need to
   balance this flexibility against the overall privacy goals of this
   consistency check.  Admitting an unbounded number of keys in the
   Issuer's directory effectively renders the consistency check
   meaningless, as each Client could be given a unique key that belongs
   to the directory set.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
